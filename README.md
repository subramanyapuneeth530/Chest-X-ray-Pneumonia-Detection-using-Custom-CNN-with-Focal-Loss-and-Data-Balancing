# Chest-X-ray-Pneumonia-Detection-using-Custom-CNN-with-Focal-Loss-and-Data-Balancing
Designed a custom CNN to classify chest X-ray images as Pneumonia or Normal. Iteratively improved the model through test cases using data balancing, resolution scaling, focal loss, and regularization techniques to enhance performance and generalization.
